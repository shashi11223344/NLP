## Data Preprocessing
The dataset underwent various preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, tokenization, converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation, and stopwords.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory data analysis was performed to gain insights into the data and understand its distribution, relationships, and patterns. Visualizations such as histograms, word clouds, and bar charts were used for analysis.

## Feature Engineering
Feature engineering involved transforming the text data into numerical representations using techniques like TF-IDF vectorization. This step is crucial for feeding the data into machine learning models.

## Model Building
Several machine learning models were considered for fake news detection, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
- CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

The models were trained, evaluated, and compared based on their performance metrics.

## Evaluation Metrics
The performance of each model was evaluated using metrics such as:
- Accuracy
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

## Results
Based on the evaluation results, the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model was chosen for its superior performance in detecting fake news.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the application of data analysis and machine learning techniques for fake news detection. The GRU model proved to be effective in predicting the authenticity of news articles, providing valuable insights for combating misinformation.
